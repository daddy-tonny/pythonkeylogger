Best 5 characteristics of a keylogger (conceptual & defensive view)

Stealth (Low Visibility)

Operates silently without alerting the user

Minimal CPU, memory, and disk usage

Avoids obvious pop-ups or performance slowdown
👉 This is why keyloggers are dangerous and hard to detect

Persistence

Remains active after system reboots

Automatically starts with the operating system

Resists accidental termination
👉 Defenders look for unusual startup entries and services

Data Capture Accuracy

Correctly records keystrokes in the right order

Associates keystrokes with applications or windows

Avoids data corruption or missing inputs
👉 Accuracy increases the impact of stolen credentials

Secure (or Hidden) Data Handling

Stores logs in hidden or protected locations

May encrypt captured data to avoid detection
👉 Security tools monitor suspicious file writes and encryption

Exfiltration Capability

Transfers captured data to another location (local or remote)

Often triggered periodically or when internet is available
👉 Network monitoring helps detect this behavior
